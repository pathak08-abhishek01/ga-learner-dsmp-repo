Approach taken to solve the problem
Data Set of loan applications is provided in the form of CSV. Data cleaning, removal of the Null and missing values was done first. Uncessary Index and Cloumns were removed. Data types of the columns were found, conditional filtering of data was done to find out about the percentage of approved loans on various categories. Data required for audit was prepared

Challenges faced
While working on the conditional filtering the operator precendece of '&' over '==' was creating issue, solved the same by googling the error code on stackoverflow. With proper use of parathense the above problem was removed
